# TikTok-Project-Classifying-videos-using-machine-learning
Build a machine learning model that can be used to determine whether a video contains a claim or whether it offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
# **Project: Classifying videos using machine learning**

Machine learning techniques to predict on a binary outcome variable.
<br/>

**The purpose** of this model is to mitigate misinformation in videos on the TikTok platform.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".

*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2:** Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

**Part 3:** Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
